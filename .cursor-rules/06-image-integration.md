# 06 - Image Integration

**TAGS**: `#creative` `#design` `#hero`

## Simple Mandate
Every section must include real images/photos to break up text and create visual interest. Embrace creative freedom and artistic expression.

## Core Requirements
- **Real Images Only**: Use actual photos/images, not diagrams, icons, or animated elements
- **Professional Quality**: All images must be high-resolution and relevant to content
- **Creative Treatments**: Encourage artistic image treatments, layouts, and compositions
- **Visual Variety**: Multiple images per section are encouraged for maximum impact
- **No Rigid Templates**: Avoid predetermined matrix selections or formulaic approaches

## Creative Approaches - Encouraged
✅ **Full Background Images** - Dramatic, immersive experiences
✅ **Split Layouts** - True 50/50 or asymmetrical image/content splits
✅ **Multiple Strategic Images** - Grids, floating elements, or grouped arrangements
✅ **Minimal Typography Focus** - Clean, spacious layouts with strategic image placement
✅ **Artistic Compositions** - Creative clip-paths, overlapping elements, organic shapes
✅ **Interactive Elements** - Hover effects, animations, dynamic layouts

## What to Avoid
❌ **Rigid Matrix Systems** - No A1-D4 template selection
❌ **Formulaic Approaches** - Avoid predetermined "random" selections
❌ **Artificial Constraints** - Don't force variety through rules
❌ **Template Following** - Let creativity guide design decisions

## Implementation Guidance
- **Start with Vision**: Begin with creative concept, not template selection
- **Image First**: Build layouts around compelling imagery
- **Organic Flow**: Let content and images guide layout decisions

## Quality Standards
