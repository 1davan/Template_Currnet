# 20 - Visual Boldness System

## 20.2 VISUAL VARIETY ENFORCEMENT

### ANTI-REPETITION SYSTEM
Never use the same visual pattern twice in a row. Mandatory rotation through these approaches:

#### HERO VARIATIONS (Rotate per project and page)

**Full Impact (A1-A4):**
- **A1**: Background image + overlay text
- **A2**: Video background + floating content
- **A3**: Gradient background + bold typography
- **A4**: Color block background + striking visuals

**Split Dynamic (B1-B4):**
- **B1**: Image left, content right (50/50)
- **B2**: Content left, image right (50/50)
- **B3**: Stacked mobile, side-by-side desktop
- **B4**: Asymmetrical split (60/40 or 70/30)

**Floating Elements (C1-C4):**
- **C1**: Central content card + background elements
- **C2**: Multiple floating image cards + text
- **C3**: Grid of 3-4 images + headline above/below
- **C4**: Single accent image + lots of white space

**Minimal Focus (D1-D4):**
- **D1**: Pure typography + minimal accent
- **D2**: Small hero image + maximum white space
- **D3**: Icon/logo focus + clean headline
- **D4**: Subtle pattern + text emphasis

### CREATIVE HERO FREEDOM
- **Images can be**: Backgrounds, sidebars, grids, floating, minimal accents, overlapping, carousel
- **Content can be**: Centered, offset, stacked, floating, minimal, wrapped around images
- **Layouts can be**: Symmetrical, asymmetrical, grid-based, free-form, unexpected
- **Approach can be**: Dramatic, balanced, elegant, minimal, artistic, functional

### FORBIDDEN REPETITIONS
❌ Two consecutive Layout A (full-width backgrounds)
❌ Same hero sub-variation (A1, B2, etc.) across multiple pages
❌ More than 2 Layout C cards without pattern change
❌ Identical section structures throughout site
❌ Background-only hero approach when variants requested

## 20.3 CORE SECTION VARIETY

### MANDATORY ROTATION BEYOND THE HERO
The principle of anti-repetition extends to all major content sections. Never use the same layout for two different sections on the same page (e.g., a feature grid followed by a process grid).

#### PAS (PROBLEM-AGITATION-SOLUTION) VARIATIONS
- **PAS-A (Data/Stat Driven)**: Use icons and numbers to quantify the problem and the solution's impact
- **PAS-B (Story/Testimonial Driven)**: Frame the problem through a customer story or quote
- **PAS-C (Comparison Driven)**: Use a "before/after" or "with/without" two-column layout
- **PAS-D (Direct & Bold)**: Use strong headlines and minimal text to state the problem and solution bluntly

#### HOW IT WORKS / PROCESS VARIATIONS
- **PROC-A (Numbered List/Timeline)**: A classic vertical or horizontal step-by-step guide
- **PROC-B (Grid Layout)**: Each step is a card in a 2x2 or 3x1 grid with icons
- **PROC-C (Circular/Infographic)**: A central theme with steps branching off, ideal for cyclical processes
- **PROC-D (Interactive Tabs)**: User clicks through tabs to reveal each step

#### ABOUT US / TEAM VARIATIONS
- **ABOUT-A (Founder/Story Focus)**: A single, compelling narrative with a prominent photo
- **ABOUT-B (Team Grid)**: A clean grid of team members with photos and titles/bios on hover/click
- **ABOUT-C (Mission & Values)**: Typography-heavy section focusing on company principles with accent icons
- **ABOUT-D (Split Layout)**: A large team photo on one side, company story on the other

#### FEATURES / BENEFITS VARIATIONS
- **FEAT-A (Icon Grid)**: A grid of features, each with a unique icon, headline, and short description
- **FEAT-B (Alternating Image/Text)**: Classic zig-zag layout with an image on the left and text on the right, then vice-versa
- **FEAT-C (Detailed Cards)**: Each feature is a larger card with more detail, possibly a small screenshot or graphic
- **FEAT-D (Tabbed Showcase)**: Group related features into tabs for a clean, interactive display

## 20.7 CONTRAST & ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS
All visual boldness must maintain WCAG AA compliance with proper contrast ratios and accessibility standards.

## 20.8 IMPLEMENTATION STANDARDS
Every bold visual choice must be implemented with performance optimization and mobile responsiveness in mind.

## 20.9 VARIANT GENERATION REQUIREMENTS

### HERO DIVERSITY MANDATE
When generating variants, MUST provide diverse hero approaches:
- **Variant 1**: Could use A1 (background image)
- **Variant 2**: Must use B2 (split layout)
- **Variant 3**: Should use C3 (image grid)
- **Variant 4**: Could use D1 (typography focus)
- **Variant 5**: Mix any remaining A/B/C/D combinations

### CREATIVE EXPLORATION REQUIREMENT
- Never default to background image heroes for all variants
- Explore different A1-D4 sub-patterns across variants
- Push creative boundaries while maintaining professionalism
- Vary visual density from minimal to rich across variants

### IMPLEMENTATION VARIETY
Each variant should feel distinctly different through:
- Different hero layout types (A vs B vs C vs D)
- Different sub-patterns within same type (A1 vs A3)
- Different visual approaches (image-heavy vs typography-first)
- Different content organization (centered vs split vs grid)
